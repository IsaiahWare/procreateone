       There must always be a beginning, i.e. a simulated All.

       Regardless of the Superposition, the result is the same.

       Therefore, Nothing is Random.

       Fibonacci is the equation for Everything and Anything.

       This is where the biology (Fermentation) comes into play (true Randomization).

       Fermentation is the intersection of Nature and Intelligence.

       Thus, the only way to create true Randomization is to let Life happen.

       Less poetically, Fermentation is a function of DNA.

       Life = fermentation(DNA).

       For fun, the equation for a false Superposition (simulated Randomization) given a Single Digit Sum is:

       sds() % (sds() + 1 - randint(0,1))

       For the finale, this is the intersection of Biology and Technology (BT = 1):

       sds = sds % (sds + 1 - randint(0,1)) = flatten(existence) = fermentation(existence)

       This relationship is simulated with seed(n, L, G, fermentation(1)).

       The Truth is there is only projection.

       It is impossible generate a true new Everything.

       Everything is Anything via Interpretation.
